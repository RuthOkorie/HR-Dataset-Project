# Employee Attrition Analysis

### Project Overview
The Employee Attrition Analysis is a data-driven visualization designed to uncover key insights into workforce attrition. This dashboard aggregates and presents data on employee turnover, department-based attrition, education level, gender distribution, age groups, and job roles to identify patterns and potential drivers of employee attrition.

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used here is HR Data.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle, FRED or any other data repository site. 

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
  - [Download Here](http://www.microsoft.com)
  1. This is used for initial data cleaning, formatting, and exploratory data analysis.
  2. It enabled me to pivot and analyze my data.
- Microsoft Power BI
  1. I leveraged Power Bi for data visualization and dashboard creation.
  2. This is used for transforming raw data into clear and insightful visuals.
- SQL
  1. This is used for querying and extracting relevant data from the the database.
  2. I employed SQL for  data manipulation.
- Google sheet     
  1. This is used to integrate multiple tools for comprehensive analysis.
  2. It is used to develop supplementary charts and graphs.
 
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of Data cleaning and preparation, I performe the following actions;
  1. Data loading and Inspection
  2. Handling missing values
  3. Data normalization
  4. Data cleaning and Formatting
  5. Data Quality check.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the data such as;
  - What are the causes of attrition
  - What is the rate of attrition.
  - What is the attrition count by department

### Data Analysis
This is where I include some basic line of codes, queries or even DAX expressions used during my analysis.
  ```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE 1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```

### Inference/ Insight
This is where I provide key findings from the analysis

  1. High Turnover in R&D and Sales: Attrition in these departments highlights the need for role-specific interventions. This may include adjusting workloads, reviewing compensation, or providing more training opportunities.
  2. Younger Employees Leaving: Younger employees in the 25-34 age range are more likely to leave. This suggests the need for career advancement programs and competitive benefits that appeal to this demographic.
  3. Impact of Education on Attrition: High attrition among employees with advanced degrees (Bachelor’s and Master’s) may indicate a mismatch between job expectations and actual roles, pointing towards the need for career alignment.
